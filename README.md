# detections

A practical, version-controlled collection of detection content: rules, queries, notes, and test ideas.

If offensive security is “how to break stuff”, this repo is the part where we learn how to **notice** it happened — fast, reliably, and with fewer false positives.

## What’s in here (and why)

This repo is for **detection engineering** artifacts, such as:

- Detection rules (e.g., Sigma-style logic)
- SIEM queries (Splunk SPL / KQL / Elastic, etc.)
- File / memory / network detections (YARA / Suricata/Snort concepts)
- Triage playbooks and investigation notes
- Small scripts to validate, normalize, or test rules

Goal: keep everything **searchable, reviewable, and improvable** over time.
